    1.We had only finished part of the Face module

    1.完成了椭圆函数的升级，允许设置其斜度、位置、弧度等参数
    2.基本完成了大部分的工作，五官，头发，独角适配良好
    3.眼瞳、眉毛等的方向问题仍未解决
    4.头发、口鼻部分线条略显粗糙
    
    1.The function "Eclipse" is upgrated, allowing us to set the slope, position and radian, etc.
    2.Most of the drawing are done and matched
    3.Direction of pupils and qyebrow still remain to be adjusted in later version
    4.Hair, mouth and nose need futher optimization

    1.将提高draw函数部分的可读性，可以考虑将他们独立封装
    2.增加参数数量，同时将它们转移到交互区，便于封装使用
    
    1.We aim to make the "draw" functions more readable, and consider maybe they can be seperately encapsulated.
    2.Add more diameters, while transit them into the interative zone, which benefits the users.
